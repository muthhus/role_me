= RoleMe

Adds simple role handling to model.

== How to use

Supose you have a User model:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_roles
    end

Then, you have:

    user = User.first
    user.has_role! :admin     # adds the admin role to the model
    user.has_role? :admin     # checks if the model has the admin role

== has_roles Options

* :role_class
  RoleMe::Role by default. You can use you own role model, just pass it through here. There are few restrictions when you use your own model:
  * You must implement the `create_with_name(role_name)` method. To create a role with the name.
  * You must implement a `by_name(role_name)` scope. To select a role by it's name.

* :role_join_table
  This is the name pf the join table between the roled and the role model. By default "role_me_roles_join".


== Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'role_me'

And use the role_me:role_migration generator to create the role migration, if you are using the gem role model.

    rails generator role_me:role_migration
